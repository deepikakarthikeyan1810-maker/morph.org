  <h2>Research Projects</h2>
  <p>
    MORPH undertakes multidisciplinary applied research projects including occupational
    disease surveillance, injury risk mapping, ergonomic assessments, industrial exposure
    studies, wearable-based monitoring, and predictive health analytics. Projects are
    field-oriented, data-driven, and designed to inform preventive action and system
    improvement.
  </p>

<!-- ================= PUBLICATIONS / ACHIEVEMENTS ================= -->
<section>
  <h2>Publications / Achievements</h2>
  <p>
    MORPH documents institutional achievements through technical reports, program
    outcomes, completed projects, training milestones, and collaborative initiatives.
    Achievements reflect successful implementation, capacity building, and system
    strengthening rather than academic publishing metrics.

<section>
  <h2>Research & Operational Services</h2>
</section>

<!-- ================= 4.1 ================= -->
<section><ul>
  <h3><li>Occupational Health Research & Workplace Risk Assessment</li></h3></ul>
  <p>
    MORPH conducts structured workplace health assessments to identify physical,
    chemical, biological, ergonomic, and psychosocial hazards. Activities include
    baseline worker health profiling, job hazard analysis, task-based exposure
    evaluation, and injury risk mapping. Findings are translated into practical
    recommendations for hazard control and workforce protection. The service supports
    compliance, prevention planning, and long-term occupational health strategies.
    All assessments involve direct field engagement.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= 4.2 ================= -->
<section><ul>
  <h3><li> Industrial Hygiene & Environmental Monitoring</li></h3></ul>
  <p>
    MORPH performs quantitative monitoring of workplace environments, including air
    quality, noise exposure, thermal stress, lighting, and ergonomic load. Standardized
    instruments and calibrated sensors are used to ensure data accuracy. Exposure data
    are analyzed to assess risk levels and control effectiveness. Outputs support
    engineering controls, administrative measures, and safety program improvement.
    The focus is on measurable risk reduction.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= 4.3 ================= -->
<section><ul>
  <h3><li> Epidemiological Field Studies & Surveillance</li></h3></ul>
  <p>
    MORPH designs and executes field-based epidemiological studies to understand injury
    patterns, disease trends, and risk factors among workers and communities. Data are
    collected through surveys, health camps, interviews, and monitoring activities.
    Analytical outputs guide targeted interventions and surveillance strengthening.
    Emphasis is placed on operational decision-making rather than academic dissemination.
    These studies support planning and policy implementation.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= 4.4 ================= -->
<section><ul>
  <h3><li> Health Data Management & Analytics</li></h3></ul>
  <p>
    MORPH provides end-to-end data handling services, including data cleaning,
    validation, structuring, and integration from multiple sources. Statistical and
    analytical workflows are applied to generate actionable insights. Outputs include
    dashboards, summaries, and decision-support indicators. Analytics are designed to
    be understandable and usable by non-technical stakeholders. Data integrity and
    confidentiality are strictly maintained.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= 4.5 ================= -->
<section><ul>
  <h3><li> AI & Predictive Risk Analytics</li></h3></ul>
  <p>
    MORPH applies machine learning and AI tools to predict injury risk, hazard
    probability, and compliance gaps. Services include data annotation, model
    development, testing, and deployment into operational systems. Predictive tools
    support proactive risk management and early warning mechanisms. AI solutions are
    practical, interpretable, and implementation-focused. The goal is prevention, not
    experimentation.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= 4.6 ================= -->
<section><ul>
  <h3><li> Digital Health, Wearables & Monitoring Systems</li></h3></ul>
  <p>
    MORPH integrates wearable devices and digital platforms to monitor fatigue, stress,
    physical strain, and safety behavior in real-world settings. Continuous data streams
    enable trend detection and early intervention. Digital tools enhance workforce
    monitoring and health surveillance. Systems are designed for scalability and routine
    use. This supports preventive occupational health practice.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= 4.7 ================= -->
<section><ul>
  <h3><li> Health Informatics & Systems Support</li></h3>
  </ul>
  <p>
    MORPH develops dashboards, registries, and health information systems linked to
    HMIS, SMIS, or organizational records. Emphasis is placed on interoperability,
    real-time access, and usability. These systems strengthen reporting, surveillance,
    and planning functions. MORPH supports organizations in building sustainable digital
    health infrastructure. The approach is system-centric and operational.
